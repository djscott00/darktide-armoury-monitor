If you're not already familiar with the Armoury Exchange extension for Darktide, please see: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1000s5t/formally_announcing_the_armoury_exchange/

This is executable that will run locally and continuously scrape your Armoury Exchange results for matches. When matches are encountered, a new browser window will be launched, and you can also receive some alerts via another 3rd party service of LogSnag.

This has only been developed and tested on Windows, and **works best with Firefox** (Chrome is not quite behaving as expected).
